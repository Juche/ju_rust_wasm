## Recommended Toolchains

> The React team primarily recommends these solutions:

If you’re learning React or creating a new single-page app, use Create React App.
If you’re building a server-rendered website with Node.js, try Next.js.
If you’re building a static content-oriented website, try Gatsby.
If you’re building a component library or integrating with an existing codebase, try `More Flexible Toolchains`.

### More Flexible Toolchains

The following toolchains offer more flexibility and choice. We recommend them to more experienced users:

Neutrino combines the power of webpack with the simplicity of presets, and includes a preset for React apps and React components.
Nx is a toolkit for full-stack monorepo development, with built-in support for React, Next.js, Express, and more.
Parcel is a fast, zero configuration web application bundler that works with React.
Razzle is a server-rendering framework that doesn’t require any configuration, but offers more flexibility than Next.js.
